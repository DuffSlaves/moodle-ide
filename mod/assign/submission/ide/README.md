# moodle-ide
An assignment submission plugin for moodle built around the CodeMirror IDE.
This is an inital concept. Eventually once this is finished, I will have a proof of concept for the web-browser integrated IDE
along with moodle assignment submissions. The end goal for this project will be to make a custom module for interactive coding in moodle.
